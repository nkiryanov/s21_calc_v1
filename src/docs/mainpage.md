# Documentation for SmartCalc v1 {#mainpage}

This is the simple documentation for SmartCalc. It is limited because the code itself speaks more than a thousand words and is always correct.

The library `calc_rpm` (Reverse Polish Notation evaluation library) is 100% covered.\n
Please review them if something is not clear enough.
